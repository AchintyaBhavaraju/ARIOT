#Make the AR scene using the scene composer 
#This project showcases an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using Xcode and the ARKit/RealityKit framework, designed to bring a unique and interactive dining experience to users. The application allows users to place a virtual dining table, complete with a variety of food items, into their real-world environment. Leveraging ARKit's/RealityKit's advanced capabilities, users can interact with the virtual table, explore food items in detail, and engage in a seamless blend of the physical and digital worlds.

USE CASE -  The possibilities of AR are endless, but in this case, we can use AR specifically for real estate and interior design. We can see the turnout of a building in a plot, or the furnishings of a house before even purchasing the furniture. This can help determine the amount of space occupied and the amount of space necessary given a specific area. It is very useful and can be easily implemented in the real-world.

#To enhance realism, the app dynamically adjusts lighting and shadows based on the user's physical environment. Primarily shiny objects with picked textures such as "Gold/brass/copper/silver/steel/" or otherwise.

#In this case, I made a table with a bagel and a watermelon on a table

#After the scene is made, write code to view in an application-like interface, this is done using Swift on Xcode
